**`Frontend Developer`**

I'm a MSc Molecular Medicine graduate transitioned into a frontend developer and blogger. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I'm looking to collaborate on more projects and I'm currently seeking career opportunities in the Technology Industry.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Jeremiah's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

In June 2022, I made the decision to transition into the Technology industry. While being employed at a hospital working late-shifts, I used my free time to research and create a constructive plan as to how I‚Äôll achieve my goal to becoming a frontend developer. After several weeks of deciding whether this was the right choice for myself, I decided to give in my notice, and dedicate my time to learning and utilising complex programme languages. I have initiated multiple courses to expand my computer programming skillset which has provided me with advanced knowledge of a variety of programming languages, tools and frameworks. Having previously contributed to scientific studies, I believe it is imperative to collaborate towards team projects. I had the courage to apply my knowledge by contributing to my first collaborative app project made with a small group of developers on Discord. I've been able to discuss my experience and journey with other developers in the form of blogs and daily updates in the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter.

My dream is to land my first role as a frontend developer - I have a way to go but with the support of developer network I know it's not far away.
